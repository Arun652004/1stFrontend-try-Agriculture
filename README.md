This is the First time i had made Frontend completely and yes i realise these days people are just doing Ctrl + C and Ctrl+ V to make changes and just do some changes...well i was not aware of that until someone told me..so rather than letting it go to waste i am uploading here...

i made this Frontend for my College Group Project which was Agriculture Robot to detect diseases in Tomato crop

The purpose of this website was to show what was the disease the crop had..it fully didn't go exactly as planned but still working on it...
